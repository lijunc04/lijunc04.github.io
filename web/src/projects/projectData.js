As my first internship, this on-site opportunity gave me plentiful hands-on experience working with fantastic AI engineers at Huawei and solving many computer vision tasks together. One of the main tasks I worked on was using AI models to improve rain scene capturing, along with some other photographic methods. I was mainly responsible for coming up with potential AI solutions and training and testing models verifying those solutions.",
